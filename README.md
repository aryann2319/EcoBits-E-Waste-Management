The increasing proliferation of electronic devices and rapid technological advancements have led to an alarming rise in electronic waste (e-waste), posing significant environmental, health, and logistical challenges. A lack of accessible, user-friendly platforms for proper e-waste disposal and recycling has resulted in improper handling of discarded electronics, including unsafe dumping, burning, and inefficient recycling practices. 

EcoBits aims to address this critical issue by offering a comprehensive, streamlined platform that simplifies e-waste collection, facilitates recycling, and fosters community engagement. By integrating user-centric features such as scheduled pickups, e-commerce for upcycled products, and educational initiatives, EcoBits seeks to create a scalable, sustainable solution for effective e-waste management while promoting environmental responsibility.
